## Set up R / RStudio

Use AppsAnywhere

* Click this [direct link to the correct version](https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk?id=2468&name=R%20for%20Windows%20Suite%204.2.1)
* Or visit [AppsAnywhere's homepage](https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk) and use the search box and paste in `R for Windows Suite 4.2.1` - avoid accidentally choosing one of the many alternatives with similar names - then star it to add it to your favourites so you can find it again more easily next time
* Now you can fire up `RStudio` by clicking on the windows start button and typing `RStudio`
* If you're on a Mac, ask Matt to set it up for you in the class, or see the links for [R itself](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and for [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)


## Set up for the course _R for beginners_

The course consists of a website at [mjgreen.github.io/workbook](https://mjgreen.github.io/workbook/) and an R package `beginr` at  [mjgreen.github.io/beginr](https://mjgreen.github.io/beginr).

We make extensive use of the University of Glasgow's _introdataviz_ approach - a tutorial that teaches how to use R's plotting routines to carry out visual exploratory data analysis - with 3 main components:

* A __journal article__[^1] in pdf format for printing: as well as a __revised version__[^2] that corrects some errors in the published article
* An __interactive website__[^3] that gives the code that generates each plot in the article; the images of the plots themselves; some explanatory material in plain English; and some self-test exercises with their solutions. 
* An Rmarkdown __workbook__[^4] which you use to run the code on your own computer and record your answers to the self-tests from the website, together with the __output from the workbook__[^5]
