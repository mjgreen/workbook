## Data Visualization Using R, for Researchers Who Do Not Use R

We make extensive use of the University of Glasgow's `introdataviz` approach, _Data Visualization Using R, for Researchers Who Do Not Use R_ [(Nordmann et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459221074654)

## Set up R

* Use Appsanywhere
  * Direct link is [https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk?id=2468&name=R%20for%20Windows%20Suite%204.2.1](https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk?id=2468&name=R%20for%20Windows%20Suite%204.2.1)
    * or:
  * Use the search box and paste in __R for Windows Suite 4.2.1__ (avoids being misled by the alternatives with similar names -- then add it to your favourites so you can find it again more easily)
