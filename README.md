## Data visualization using R, for researchers who don't use R

We make extensive use of the University of Glasgow's _introdataviz_ approach (Nordmann, E., McAleer, P., Toivo, W., Paterson, H. & DeBruine, L. (2022). Data visualisation using R, for researchers who don't use R. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science. https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459221074654)

## Set up R

Use AppsAnywhere

* Click this [direct link to the correct version](https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk?id=2468&name=R%20for%20Windows%20Suite%204.2.1)
* Or visit [AppsAnywhere's homepage](https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk) and use the search box and paste in `R for Windows Suite 4.2.1` -- avoid accidentally choosing one of the many alternatives with similar names -- then star it to add it to your favourites so you can find it again more easily next time
* Now you can fire up `RStudio` by clicking on the windows start button and typing `RStudio`
* If you're on a Mac, ask Matt to set it up for you in the class, or see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ for R itself and  https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download for Rstudio
