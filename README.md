<!--, _Data Visualization Using R, for Researchers Who Do Not Use R_ [(Nordmann et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459221074654)-->

## Set up R

* Use Appsanywhere
  * Click this [direct link](https://appsanywhere.bournemouth.ac.uk?id=2468&name=R%20for%20Windows%20Suite%204.2.1)
    * or:
  * Use the search box and paste in `R for Windows Suite 4.2.1` (avoids being misled by the alternatives with similar names -- then star it to add it to your favourites so you can find it again more easily next time)
